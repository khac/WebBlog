# WebBlog
All Flask applications must create an application instance. The web server passes all
requests it receives from clients to this object for handling, using a protocol called
Web Server Gateway Interface.

Clients such as web browsers send requests to the web server, which in turn sends
them to the Flask application instance. The return value of this view function is the response
the client receives. If the client is a web browser, this response is the document that is
displayed to the user in the browser window.

A request object, which encapsulates the HTTP request sent by the client. There are two contexts in Flask: the application context and the request context.
